# Self-Analysis Using Corporate Email Data

# 1. Description of Dataset
The dataset comprises email records extracted from my baturalp.terzi@sabanciuniv.edu .mbox file (1.8 GB), containing communication data since I started university. The source of the dataset is the Google Takeout of my Google Account. Each record corresponds to an individual email and includes metadata such as sender, recipient(s), subject line, timestamp, and email body.

# Key Features:

- Metadata: Sender, recipients, date, and time.
- Textual Content: Subject lines and email bodies.
- Communication frequency (daily, weekly, monthly).
- Word count, and common keywords.
- Time-based patterns (hour of day, day of week, etc.).
- Social network relationships (most frequent correspondents).
- The dataset provides a unique opportunity for self-reflection by analyzing communication trends, behaviors, and relationships over time.

# 2. Project Idea
This project uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visualization, and machine learning techniques to uncover insights about communication habits and patterns. By analyzing the email dataset, (For now, new questions can be added through the development stage) I seek to answer questions such as:

- When am I most active in communication, and how does this vary over time?
- Who are my most significant collaborators, and how have these relationships evolved?
- Are there any anomalies or patterns indicating changes in focus or behavior?
- How has my email activity changed over the years? Are there specific periods of higher or lower communication frequency?
Through these analyses, the project will provide actionable insights into my productivity, social network, and trends.

# 3. Project Plan

# Step 1: Data Preprocessing

- Normally dataset needs to be cleaned to get rid of spam, or irrelevant emails, but I did not use my email for any commercial communication.
- Extract and engineer features, including:
* Communication frequency.
* Email length (word count, character count).
* Time-based attributes (hour, day, month).
* Textual features (keywords, sentiment, topics).

# Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

Perform descriptive analysis to summarize email activity.
Analyze communication patterns over time (daily, weekly, and monthly trends).
Identify top correspondents and explore the dynamics of these relationships.
Examine variations in email length, response times, and frequency.

# Step 3: Visualization

Create visualizations to represent findings, including:
Line plots for time-series trends.
Heatmaps for activity distribution by the time of day and day of the week.
Word clouds to highlight common themes or keywords.
Network graphs to visualize social connections and clusters.

# Step 4: Machine Learning Applications

This step is not clear since the topic belongs to Week 10. As I know with ML Models, some kind of anomaly detection or topic modeling can be implemented.

# Step 5: Insights and Documentation

Synthesize findings to address the project’s key questions.
Reflect on personal habits, productivity, and relationships based on the results.
Document the findings, and lessons learned.
